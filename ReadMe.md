# Lung Cancer Detection and Classification

This project utilizes the IQ-OTH/NCCD - Lung Cancer Dataset and the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images dataset for machine learning tasks related to lung cancer detection, classification, and segmentation. Our objective is to develop models that can accurately identify and characterize lung cancer lesions through image-based analyses. We have achieved an accuracy of 98%.

## Datasets

### IQ-OTH/NCCD - Lung Cancer Dataset
This dataset primarily consists of medical images relevant to lung cancer, including:
- X-rays
- CT scans
- MRI images
- Histopathological slides

These images are categorized into three types:
- **Normal cases**: Representing healthy lung conditions.
- **Benign cases**: Representing non-cancerous abnormalities.
- **Malignant cases**: Representing cancerous lung tissues.

### Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images Dataset
This supplementary dataset comprises histopathological images specifically focused on lung and colon cancer tissues, providing microscopic insights into the cellular composition and structural characteristics of cancerous tissues. It complements the radiological perspectives provided by the primary dataset.

## Project Goals

- **Lung Cancer Detection**: Develop models capable of accurately identifying lung cancer lesions.
- **Classification**: Categorize lung conditions into normal, benign, and malignant cases.
- **Segmentation**: Segment the lung images to isolate areas of interest, such as lesions or tumors.

## Methodology

### Image Processing and Feature Extraction
We employ various image processing techniques to enhance the quality of the images and extract meaningful features. These features are used to train machine learning models.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
We utilize different machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models. These models are trained to analyze the relationships between the extracted features and lung cancer occurrence or progression.

### Evaluation
Our project evaluates the performance of these models across different imaging modalities and tissue types. By comparing the results from the primary dataset with the supplementary dataset, we aim to understand the strengths and limitations of the models in different contexts.

## Applications
Researchers and practitioners can use this project for:
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood of lung cancer development.
- **Early Detection**: Identifying lung cancer at an early stage.
- **Prognosis Prediction**: Forecasting the likely course and outcome of the disease.
- **Treatment Response Forecasting**: Predicting how a patient might respond to treatment.

## Conclusion
By leveraging medical images and advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient care in the context of lung cancer.
